# Logitech G513 Keyboard GUI Linux 

Simple(ish) GUI program to change the colours and one day effects of your Logitech keyboard on Linux.
Nowhere near finished, laggy as all hell unless you build in release mode.

Can currently make all but 6 keys, white only.

## Run

`cargo run --release --bin g513_gui`


Inspired by (and using) a command line version at the following repo.
